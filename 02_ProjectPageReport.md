
## Summary (Summarize the bug encountered concisely)

   On the GitLab project creation page, I noticed a typo in the button label. Instead of saying "Create blank project", it says "Create black project", which looks like a spelling mistake.


## Steps to reproduce     
   Go to: https://gitlab.com/projects/new#blank_project

   Look at the button that should help create a blank project

   The button says "Create black project" instead of "blank"
   

## What is the current bug behavior?

   The button or link on the page says "Create black project".  

## What is the expected correct behavior?

   It should say "Create blank project", because thatâ€™s the correct feature name and the user might get confused with the word "black".

     
## Relevant logs and/or screenshots
   This is a front-end display issue, so no logs are needed.

## Possible fixes

   Maybe the developer made a small typo in the label. The word "black" should be corrected to "blank".
