> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
It was more interesting than I expected. I realized that testing helps improve my precision with English vocabulary, such as learning the difference between terms like "click button" and "expand".

     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
I started by using ChatGPT to generate a basic test case template. Then, I customized the content step by step based on the actual behavior of the webpage I was testing.
- 
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
For now, I find the current tools and the syntax quite simple and easy to understand, so I don't feel the need to switch.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
Visual Code
- 


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-I was a bit confused about what should go into the Variables section and what could just be written directly in the test steps. In the end, I decided to store any values that might be reused into the Variables section to keep things clean and consistent.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
 I didn’t encounter issues this time. I have used GitHub before in previous courses and personal projects, so I’m somewhat familiar with the platform.

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would choose Robot Framework because it's easy to read, beginner-friendly, and works well for keyword-driven test cases. I’ve already had some experience using it in this course.
-



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing


The most in-demand skills include:

Selenium

Python or Java

REST API testing

CI/CD tools (like Jenkins or GitLab CI)

Test case management tools (like Jira, TestRail)

Knowledge of Agile/Scrum

Communication and collaboration skills




## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?


-LLanguage proficiency – especially in technical English. Soft skills like clear communication and attention to detail are also essential.



## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-Yes, I think this project was very helpful. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge into actual practice. However, I hope that in future modules, we can have more practical assignments related to the kinds of test reports that we saw in the lectures. That would help bridge the gap between reading examples and doing it hands-on.
